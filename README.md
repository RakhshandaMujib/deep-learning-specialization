# Deep Learning Specialization - Hands-On Journey

*An engineer’s logbook for mastering deep learning foundations and beyond.*

This repository tracks my journey through [Andrew Ng’s Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/).  
Unlike a simple course dump, this is a **practitioner’s portfolio** - documenting my hands-on experiments, insights, and implementations as I sharpen my deep learning skills **while working full-time as an engineer**.

---

## 📌 Why This Repo?
- **Applied mindset** - Connecting theory to real-world ML use cases.  
- **Transparency** - Documenting progress (including struggles) for accountability.  
- **Consistency** - Building expertise systematically while juggling a full-time role.

## ✅ Progress Tracker
### Course Modules
- [x] **Neural Networks & Deep Learning** - Basics of deep learning, vectorization, shallow networks  
- [x] **Improving Deep Neural Networks** - Hyperparameter tuning, regularization, optimization  
- [x] **Structuring Machine Learning Projects** - Error analysis, bias/variance handling  
- [ ] **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** - *(current focus)*  
- [ ] **Sequence Models** - RNNs, LSTMs, and attention mechanisms

## 📌 What’s Next?
- Revisit Course 1-3 notebooks (done originally in 2022) & clean them for clarity.
- Dive deep into CNNs (Course 4), sharing experiments and visualizations.
- Capstone: Build a small end-to-end deep learning project using these foundations.

## 📎Reflections Log
I maintain weekly notes in `/logs/` covering:
- Key learnings  
- Challenges faced (and how I overcame them)  
- How each concept might apply to real-world systems  

This helps me connect theory to practice - and serves as a reference for future projects.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python (NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras)  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Workflow**: Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub for version control

## 🤝 Contributions
This repo isn’t just about learning deep learning. It’s about showing that growth is deliberate, consistent, and applied - even while managing a full‑time role as an engineer. 
This is a personal refresher, but feel free to fork and adapt it to your own style or stack.
