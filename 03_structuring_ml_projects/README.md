# Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects

**Completed:** 2022 (Revisiting in 2025)

### What I Learned
- **Error analysis frameworks**: Systematically diagnosing whether issues are bias, variance, or data mismatch  
- **Prioritization**: Deciding what to fix first when resources are limited  
- **Transfer learning & multi-task learning**: Leveraging pre-trained models effectively  
- **Iterative development**: Building fast, getting feedback, and refining quickly  

### My Takeaways
This was less code-heavy but deeply influential. It made me think like an **ML engineer** instead of just a model builder.  
Now I analyze ML problems holistically, from dataset curation to error breakdowns, before jumping to solutions.
